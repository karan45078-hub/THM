So after getting the ip we first opened it into the browser it serves as a default homepage of apache server

The nmap result was

```
Meaning we can do something with vsftpd 3.0.5 that is **CVE-2025-14242**

But we can't do anything with it is for the Ddos.

The important section in the source code i found was

```html
<title>Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works! If you see this add 'team.thm' to your hosts!</title>

```

after doing so it opens up a completely different page. 

Meaning the page is using virtual hosting.

![page](page.png)

The robots.txt also exist there include one name *dale*.

When doing directory bruteforcing it gave us only those pages that were inside the source code.

But as it is said in the hint of question 1.

```
As the "dev" site is under contruction maybe it has some flaws? "url?=" + "This rooms picture" 
```

So first i did add dev.team.thm into the /etc/hosts file.

Then accessed the dev page.

![dev](dev.png)

Now there is a link when tapped onto it gave us irrelevent page but the url was not

```
http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=teamshare.php
```

![dev_end](dev_end.png)

Here we can try for parameter tampering.

So we tried LFI paylods with ffuf
