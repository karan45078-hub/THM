So My attempt is to whenever I get the IP I always hit the IP in the browser after all basic stuff that I already mentioned in Instruction.txt file.

But doing so leads a redirect to http://lookup.thm.

So we need to do a small tweak in the file */etc/hosts*
Then where you entered the ip at the end of that ip put a single space then lookup.thm and save & exit.That's It.

Then i opened http://ip and it redirected me to http://lookup.thm then i saw a login page.

But i tried to do *Directory Enumuration* so i found directories are

```
200 -    1B  - /login.php
```

That's it i got.
so the page http://lookup.thm/login.php was a login page.

<login_page>

When viewing its source code:-

<source_code>

We can see the username and password parameter in the source code clearly.
Using this parameter We will hit a curl req with below command to test for valid req.

```
curl -X POST http://lookup.thm/login.thm -d "username=orion&password=1234"
```

And it was working it gave me the real wrong credentials error that i got in browser manual login too.

That means we can do req to login.thm in this way.

But without jumping to password bruteforcing i tried for sqli and it was not working.

Now finally that we are waiting for..

#Bruteforcing Login Page
 For this we are going to use ffuf.
 So we will do the below command to do enumuration to login page.

```
ffuf -u
