for the first hash its hint already says that its a md5 hash. the hash is 

```
48bb6e862e54f2a795ffc4e541caed4d
```

Now we can search for any md5 hash decoder and enter this hash and we will get the decoded result.

**easy**

For the second hash its hint says *Sha..But which version*

We will now analyse the hash *CBFDAC6008F9CAB4083784CBD1874F76618D2A97*

```
The key clue is length.

This hash is 40 hexadecimal characters
Each hex character = 4 bits → 40 × 4 = 160 bits

That matches SHA-1, which produces 160-bit hashes (40 hex chars).
```

Now i seached onlinne for sha1 decoder and feed it the sha 1 hash *CBFDAC6008F9CAB4083784CBD1874F76618D2A97*

This gave me the decoded result *password123*


Now lets go onto the 3rd hash its hint says *Sha..*

But it is similar like the above one so we need to ananlyse the hash again *1C8BFE8F801D79745C4631D09FFF36C82AA37FC4CCE4FC946683D7B336B63032*

```
 The key clue is length.

 This hash is 64 hexadecimal characters
 Each hex character = 4 bits → 64 × 4 = 256 bits

 That  matches SHA-256, which produces 256-bit hashes (64 hex chars).
```

Again we will seach onlien for sha 256 decoder and decode it online.

The decoded result was *letmein*

Now lets goto out third hash that is *$2y$12$Dwt1BZj6pcyc3Dy1FWZ5ieeUznr71EeNkJkUlypTsgbX1H68wsRom*

And its hint says 

```
Search the hashcat examples page (https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) for $2y$. This type of hash can take a very long time to crack, so either filter rockyou for four character words, or use a mask for four lower case alphabetical characters.
```

The hint is saying to analyse the hash from that specific url but we gonna use the chatgpt for analysign that hash.
