as it is told in the room page already that machine was accessible at http://10.49.181.116:5000

When i went at that page i saw

the task of this room was find a way to purchase the hidden item.

Now tappable items are signup login and some products.

The source code was also not helpful.

Then i go to signup and make a account and signup with it. after the login we can see credits is equal to zero.

Now there is something interesting that when we are loggeed in with the user account and when we are opening the product page it is showing us a role.

Now as it is showing role we can try to change role from the inspect tab.

When i did visited to application tab of inspect tab then cookies there was  a jwt token there we will try to modify the token and lets see waht happens. 

Previously this token was 

tryheartme_jwt:eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6Imd1ZXN0QGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsInJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwiY3JlZGl0cyI6MCwiaWF0IjoxNzc2NTgyODI5LCJ0aGVtZSI6InZhbGVudGluZSJ9.V1qBFtAwOhBWuPFutzpATGT8SN7V0xjCDprbc2JgHmI


This jwt token contains this data 

```
{
  "email": "guest@gmail.com",
  "role": "user",
  "credits": 0,
  "iat": 1776582829,
  "theme": "valentine"
}
```


and this header 

```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

And using the same data but with role=admin i made a another jwt token and replaced the current jwt token with the fresly made.


```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6Imd1ZXN0QGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsInJvbGUiOiJhZG1pbiIsImNyZWRpdHMiOjAsImlhdCI6MTc3NjU4MjgyOSwidGhlbWUiOiJ2YWxlbnRpbmUifQ.b7Uza8q9taClisYffV6ehTwwKDCVJHbMi12cGMpuXts
```

Now as i put this jwt token in the inspect tab and refrested the tab it gave me the admin acess of the page now i am signed in a admin. and i have token 5000.

As i goto the homepage of the site now where the product are listed i could see that hidden product

Now as we will tap onto this product and hit buy it gave us the flag.
